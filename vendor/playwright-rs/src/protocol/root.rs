/// Root object for sending the initialize message to the Playwright server
///
/// This is an internal object not exposed to end users. It exists solely to
/// send the `initialize` message to the server during connection setup.
///
/// # Protocol Flow
///
/// When `initialize()` is called:
/// 1. Sends `initialize` message with `sdkLanguage: "rust"`
/// 2. Server creates BrowserType objects (sends `__create__` messages)
/// 3. Server creates Playwright object (sends `__create__` message)
/// 4. Server responds with Playwright GUID: `{ "playwright": { "guid": "..." } }`
/// 5. All objects are now in the connection's object registry
///
/// The Root object has an empty GUID (`""`) and is not registered in the
/// object registry. It's discarded after initialization completes.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// # use playwright_rs::protocol::Root;
/// # use playwright_rs::server::connection::ConnectionLike;
/// # use std::sync::Arc;
/// # async fn example(connection: Arc<dyn ConnectionLike>) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// // Create root object with connection
/// let root = Root::new(connection.clone());
///
/// // Send initialize message to server
/// let response = root.initialize().await?;
///
/// // Verify Playwright GUID is returned
/// let playwright_guid = response["playwright"]["guid"]
///     .as_str()
///     .expect("Missing playwright.guid");
/// assert!(!playwright_guid.is_empty());
/// assert!(playwright_guid.contains("playwright"));
///
/// // Verify response contains BrowserType objects
/// assert!(response["playwright"].is_object());
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
